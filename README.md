# Sims 4 Mod Assistant

Small electron app intended to help Sims players and content makers to find and move duplicates among
mods.

# Features

-   Find exact duplicates (copy-paste files with different names) - actually can be used not only for Sims mods, but for any files.

# Plans

-   Parse mod contents and find catalogue conflicts -- mods for different Sims games have different formats, I'm going to limit this app
    to Sims 4 format.

# Usage
